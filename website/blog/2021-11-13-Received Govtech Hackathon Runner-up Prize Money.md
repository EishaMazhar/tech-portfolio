The Digital Youth Summit (DYS) is a technology-focused conference that takes place annually in Peshawar, Pakistan; whereas Code for Pakistan (CFP) is a non-profit organization registered as Foundation for Civic Tech at the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, and Tech for Change in the United States as a 501(c)(3) California non-profit.

Our all-FASTians team(3 females from Pakistani Women in Computing), with a diverse skillset, was invited to #DYS (Digital Youth Summit) held in #Peshawar to receive the prize money of PKR 150,000/- by team #CFP (Code for Pakistan).

Our idea Drive(H)er, won us the second position in Govtech Hackathon'2021 which took place a few weeks before DYS and was organized by Code for Pakistan, in collaboration with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Technology Board (KPITB), and The World Bank.

Amidst our Pakistan tour, we went to Peshawer, and it proved to be worth it. The opportunity of attending DYS provided a wonderful moment to interact with leading experts including Jehan Ara, Samina Rizwan, Abu Bakar N. Alvi, Qarib Kazmi, Ali Raza, and many others.

In terms of future prospects, we will continue to work on making transportation safe and easier for females in the city, and always open for collaboration and support.
